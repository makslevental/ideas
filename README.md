## [Symbolic Fourier-Motzkin elimination](https://github.com/stephane-caron/pyfme)

not sure

## [clan](https://github.com/periscop/clan)

Chunky Loop Analyzer: A Polyhedral Representation Extraction Tool for High Level Programs

compiling is annoying [af](https://gist.github.com/9a58e1aa96b83028da4462a08ce3f441)

- [ ] python bindings
- [ ] use clan to analyze python for loops

## [langcc](https://github.com/jzimmerman/langcc)

A Next-Generation Compiler Compiler

- [ ] use it to parse python into MLIR (using [mll](https://github.com/makslevental/mll))

## [The Yices SMT Solver](https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2)

- [ ] extract the BDD and combine with PIP

## [Intel Extension for MLIR](https://github.com/intel/mlir-extensions)

- [ ] use the python frontend to lower to affine

## [SymEngine](https://github.com/symengine/symengine)

if i'm gonna solve things symbolically (ie DSA) this might be useful

## [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling)

just take for a test drive

## [Binary Decision Diagrams](https://pyeda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bdd.html)

use in combination with yices?

## [Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)](https://github.com/jfmc/ppl)

how is it different from ISL? [sage bindings?](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/numerical/sage/numerical/backends/ppl_backend.html). also [python bindings](https://github.com/haudren/pyparma)

## [TAMUparametric PPOPT](https://github.com/TAMUparametric/PPOPT)

can this solve DSA?

## [VPL (Verified Polyhedra Library)](https://github.com/VERIMAG-Polyhedra/VPL)

somewhere in here there's an implementation of a PIP solver

>Polyhedral projection is a main operation of the polyhedron abstract
domain. It can be computed via parametric linear programming (PLP),
which is more efficient than the classic Fourier-Motzkin elimination method.

^ hmm is that really true? i thought one relied on the other?

related to [this paper](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/265345708.pdf) (An efficient parametric linear programming solver and application to polyhedral projection)

## [CuPPy](https://github.com/tkralphs/CuPPy)

> A naive implementation of the Gomory cutting plane algorithm

is this faster than solving the CSP?

## [The Dynamic Runtime Inlining (DRTI) project](https://github.com/drti)

> The basic concept is to get the normal compiler front end like clang to emit its LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) as a bitcode file, then run a custom LLVM pass over this to inject DRTI code at the appropriate places.

>Interestingly, AlphaTensor finds algorithms with a larger number of additions compared with Strassen-square (or equivalently, denser decompositions), but the discovered algorithms generate individual operations that can be efficiently fused by the specific XLA33 grouping procedure and thus are more tailored towards the compiler stack we use.

## [A Scalable Approach to Exact Resource-Constrained Scheduling Based on a Joint SDC and SAT Formulation](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~zhiruz/pdfs/sds-fpga2018.pdf)
