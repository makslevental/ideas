>Polyhedral projection is a main operation of the polyhedron abstract
domain. It can be computed via parametric linear programming (PLP),
which is more efficient than the classic Fourier-Motzkin elimination method.

^ hmm is that really true? i thought one relied on the other?

related to [this paper](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/265345708.pdf) (An efficient parametric linear programming solver and application to polyhedral projection)

## [The Dynamic Runtime Inlining (DRTI) project](https://github.com/drti)

> The basic concept is to get the normal compiler front end like clang to emit its LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) as a bitcode file, then run a custom LLVM pass over this to inject DRTI code at the appropriate places.
